**Motivation** <br/>
Successive cycles of staining, imaging, and elution on the same tissue section cause misalignment of images from one cycle to the next, disrupting object detection that exploits markers from multiple image cycles. Previously, a machine learning approach using a known feature set was attempted as a remedy for misalignment. The current project seeks to enhance image features with deep learning to augment the previous approach.
